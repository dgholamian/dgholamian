### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Davoud! I'm currently delving into the world of Data Science as a Ph.D. student at the University of Western Ontario, where I'm exploring the frontiers of Federated Learning, Natural Language Processing, and other exciting fields. 

With a rich background in Data Analytics and Machine Learning, I've used my expertise to predict customer churn in the banking industry and to enhance healthcare systems.

When I'm not buried in research papers or coding away, I'm likely to be found immersing myself in the latest courses or brushing up on my language skills, being fluent in both English and Persian. 

Whether it's through Python, MATLAB, HTML, CSS, JS, or any other tool in my extensive software arsenal, I'm always crafting something new.
